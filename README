Sub-Deferrable

Sub::Deferrable implements a simple means of either executing a sub
or saving its invocation on a stack for execution later. This is
loosely analogous to deferring interrupts: normally, the interrupt
handler runs; when the interrupt is deferred, the interrupt is
queued and the handler is run later.
